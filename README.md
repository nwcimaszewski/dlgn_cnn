# CNN Identification of dLGN Response to Natural Movies

Github repository for a master's thesis project in the lab of Philipp Berens.

Python libraries developed by the Sinz Lab are fit to maximize correlation between the activity (currently quantified as binned firing rate, to be expanded to waveform convolved voltage estimates) and activation of a final layer's units.  Much of the experiment running code is .
